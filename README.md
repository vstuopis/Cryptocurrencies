# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

We implemented an unsupervised learning modal on a cryptocurrency dataset as part of our overall analysis. We began by preprocessing our data by removing data not needed for the clustering algorithm as well as reindexing the dataframe. We proceeded to use StandardScaler to standardize our features before reducing our data dimensions using PCA. After having that data, we used K-means to create an elbow curve to get the best value for K and added additional information back into the dataframe which held our clustering predictions. We completed our analysis by putting our data into a visual format.
